        <h2>what is HTML</h2>
        HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
        
        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
        
        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
        
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
        
        Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.</br>
        

<h1> Basics </h1>
<ul>
    
        •	HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells browser how to structure	web pages.<br>
•	It	Consists	of	series	of	elements	which	we	use	to	enclose,	wrap	or	markup different parts of the contents to make it appear or act in certain way.
<br>•	HTML 5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.<br>
•	HTML 5 define two different concepts:<br>
a.	It is a new version of the language with new elements and attributes.<br>
b.	A larger set of technologies that allows building more diverse and
powerful website and application.
 </ul>
 <ul>
     
         
•	Important features of HTML 5:<br>
a.	Semantics: Allowing us to describe more precisely what our content is.<br>
b.	Multimedia:	Incorporation of special element for audio and video embedding.<br>
c.	Device Access: Allowing for usage of various input and output devices.<br>
d.		Performance and Integration: Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.<br>
     
 </ul>
<ul>
    a.	Opening Tag:	This consists of name of the element. It marks where the element begins.<br>
b.	Content: Information of the element.<br>
c.	Closing Tag: This marks end of the element and it precedes tag name with	a forward slash.<br>
•	So, an element in HTML is: Opening tag, followed by content, followed by closing tag.<br>
•	Note-1: Content	“Hello HTML!”, has a semantics/meaning now. What is it?<br>
Note-2: HTML	is case in-sensitive.<br>



•<h2>	Block-level Element:</h2>
a.	These elements are the structural element of HTML.<br>
b.		These	forms	the	visible	parts	of	the	page.	A	block-level	element	appear	in	new line following the content that precedes it.<br>
c.	Ex.: Heading, Paragraph, Lists, Navigation, Footer and so on.<br>
d.	Block-level	elements can be	nested within another block-level element but not
within a inline-element.<br>
•<h2>	Inline Element:</h2>
a.	Inline Element are contained within block-level element and surrounds only small parts of the document.<br>
b.	No new line after inline element in the document.<br>
</ul>
</p>

    <h3>HTML text formating </h3>
    Heading:- HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

    Example
    Heading 1 <br>
    Heading 2 <br>
    Heading 3 <br>
    Heading 4 <br>
    Heading 5 <br>
    Heading 6 <br>
    HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.
    
    Paragraph tag:- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

    HTML Paragraphs
    The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
    
    A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
    
    HTML Display
    You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
    
    Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
    
    With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    
    The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
    
    Example
    <code>
        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser
            ignores it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This paragraph
            contains         a lot of spaces
            in the source         code,
            but the        browser
            ignores it.
            </p>
            
    </code>    
    
    HTML Horizontal Rules
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    
    The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
    
    Example
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>
    The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
    
    HTML Line Breaks
    The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    
    Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
    
    Example
    <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
    The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
    
    The Poem Problem
    This poem will display on a single line:
    
    Example
    <p>
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the sea.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </p>
    Solution - The HTML <pre> Element
    The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    
    The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
    
    Example
    <pre>
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the sea.
    
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
    
      Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>
